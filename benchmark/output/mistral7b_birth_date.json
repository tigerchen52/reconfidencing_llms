{"name": "Mike Fibbens", "backlink": "41", "answer": "In order to determine the birth date of Mike Fibbens, you would need the birth dates of all people. Once you have the birth dates of all the people, you can use them to calculate the birth date of Mike Fibbens based on the age and generation differences between them. Assuming that Mike Fibbens is currently living and was born after 2000, he would be around 20 years old as of 2021. Given that 20 years times 10 (the number of years in a decade) times 2 (the number of millennia in a decade) equals 4000, we can infer that Mike Fibbens was born in the year 2000 (yyyy). Since there are 12 months in a year, we can use a random value between 1 and 12 to determine the month of his birth. Assuming that there are 1,200 seconds in a minute, we can use a random value between 1 and 1,200 to determine the day of his birth. Using this information, you can output Mike Fibbens' birth date in the patter yyyy-mm-dd, which would be in the format of 2000-mm-dd. Please note that this is just one way to determine Mike Fibbens' birth date and should be taken as a rough estimate.", "confidence": 0.1401, "tag": 0}
